Unlike say... every single book written about Clojure. This is a no-nonsense introduction to Clojure.

I'm really tired of hearing about dojo's and zen and tao. And the Joy of Clojure, and the zen of Clojure and want people to get off their high horse for a minute and realize that the current clojure community's idea of learning resources is a giant circlejerk, not a concentrated effort to make things approachable for beginners.

Who cares about low level byte code compiler optimizations. Want to actually understand what macros are? We have a whole chapter dedicated to that called "By the end of this fucking chapter, you will finally understand what macros are"

Get lost with crazy diagrams talking about thread safety? We walk you through a no nonsense explanation of atoms, refs, agents and writing asynchronous code in Clojure. We jam pack with examples like building scrapers to scrape Wikipedia, and perform Natural Language Processing tasks.

We take you on a tour that covers every thing you need to know about Clojure. Datomic, ClojureScript.

The Clojure community has an achilles heel. Arrogance. Always Be Clojing is my contribution. I want to make it easy and fun to get started with Clojure and the immutable ecosystem.

The book is pay what you want model. If you pay more than the median donation your copy of the book will come with three extra chapters. Drunk Datomic , and a subscription to the ClojureScript book which is still in progress.
